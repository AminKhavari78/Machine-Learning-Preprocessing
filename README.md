# What Is Data Preprocessing and Why Do We Need It?
For machine learning algorithms to work, itâ€™s necessary to convert raw data into a clean data set, which means we must convert the data set to numeric data. We do this by encoding all the categorical labels to column vectors with binary values. Missing values, or NaNs (not a number) in the data set is an annoying problem. You have to either drop the missing rows or fill them up with a mean or interpolated values.

Note: Kaggle provides two data sets: training data and results data. Both data sets must have the same dimensions for the model to produce accurate results.
